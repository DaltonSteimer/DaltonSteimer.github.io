    <h2> About me </h2>
 <pre> 
Born and raised in Metro Detroit area in Michigan. Lived in Colorado for a year. Currently live in Florida.
 I moved to colorado because I wanted a change. I did not want to spend my whole life in the same place. Decided that I loved the change, but
 I wanted something more so I thought about all the different options I could explore and ultiimaly came up with going back to school.
Some of my hobbies include Snowboarding, skatebording, hiking, traveling, being outdoors, and fitness.
I have always had a passion in Technology with hardware. I enjoyed taking apart and building eltronic, figuring out what certain parts do.
I wanted to branch out and learn more about the software side of technology and I thought my best option for working with software technology was 
to go back to school for a technology based degree. 
I am currently seeking an Technology based internship for the summmer of 2022. I am open to relocating but would prefer an internship position
that would be remote.
