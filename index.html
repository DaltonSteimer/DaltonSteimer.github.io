    <h2> About me </h2>
 <pre> 
Born and raised in Metro Detroit area, Michigan. Lived in Colorado for a year. Currently live in Florida.
 I moved to colorado because I wanted a change. I did not want to spend my whole life in the same place. Decided that I love it!
Some of my hobbies include Snowboarding, skatebording, hiking, traveling, being outdoors, and fitness.
I have always had a passion in Technology and I thought my best option for working with technology was to go back to school for a technology based degree.
